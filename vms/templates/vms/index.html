        This <strong>prototype</strong> illustrates the <strong>Volunteer Management Data Space</strong> concept developed in the master's thesis.
        To keep the prototype focused and practical, several <strong>simplifications</strong> have been made:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The data model uses <strong>Person → Volunteer</strong> from <em>Schema.org</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        For the sake of alignment with the terminology employed throughout this thesis, the name <strong>Mima</strong> is used as a pseudonym and does <strong>not correspond to the actual platform</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
          The <strong>Eclipse Data Connector (EDC)</strong> is simulated through a set of <strong>simplified API endpoints</strong>,
        rather than a full distributed data exchange setup as discussed in the thesis.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Only</strong> the <strong>Volunteer</strong> data is treated as <strong>non-standardized</strong>,
        while Volunteer Events and Certificates are assumed to follow common standards.
      </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Goverment</strong> acts as both <strong>DSGA and Trust Anchor</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Explore the three main prototype scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="{% url 'vms:dashboard' request.session.volunteer_id %}">Scenario 1: Onboard an Organization into the Data Space</a></li>
      <li><a href="{% url 'vms:events_page' request.session.volunteer_id %}">Scenario 2: Advertise Events Across Platforms</a></li>
      <li><a href="{% url 'vms:certificate' request.session.volunteer_id %}">Scenario 3: Request a Volunteer Certificate</a></li>
    </ul>
